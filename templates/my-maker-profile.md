## 🎯 Why I'm Here | 为什么来这里

### Why did I join the Making More Makers course? | 为什么参加 Making More Makers 课程？

I joined Making More Makers to get back into the building spirit! I've spent a lot of my high school time toying with electronics and I can't wait to build even grander projects at DKU.


### What do I hope to gain from this experience? | 我希望从这次经历中获得什么？

I hope to gain better custom PCB design skills, as I have limited experience with designing my own PCBs. Mastering this will allow me to create more effective and unique designs.

## 💡 My Project Idea | 我的项目想法

### Project Name (if you have one) | 项目名称（如果你有的话）

Cup-actitive Lamp


### What do I want to make? | 我想做什么？

At it's core, Cup-acitive Lamp is a lamp made out of a bubble tea cup. This object that would otherwise be thrown out can be made into a sleek, buttonless, touch-activated lamp through capacitive touch technology. It is designed to be cheap and simple to produce to encourage the reusing of bubble tea cups.


### Why do I want to make this? | 为什么想做这个？

Bubble tea is a hugely popular drink, but with every order of bubble tea comes with a plastic cup, which many do not bother to recycle or reuse. This project aims to fight against this by creating something useful out of bubble tea.
